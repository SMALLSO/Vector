# What is Vector Helper?
Vector Helper is a Vector Array library written in C that provides a high-performance Vector Array that focuses on runtime security for C projects. If you've used C++ Std, you should know that the std::vector<T> template class declared in the <vector> header file provides a Vector Array, but std::vector<T> is only used in C++.
